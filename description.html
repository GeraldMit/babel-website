<p>Babel is a set of tools to make the job of globalizing
Eclipse projects easier. We also want to provide ways for people world
wide, who are interested, to contribute translations in their language
of choice.</p>
<p>The project includes tools and activities that
are needed to adapt the Eclipse deliverables to properly run in multiple
locales and to translate selected Eclipse projects into multiple
different languages (French, Japanese, German, etc). The project could
eventually include tools to aid in the following areas: Enablement testing (E.g.
can the software run in different language environments and handle
multiple scripts, etc.), translatability testing (is it ready for
translation?), preparation for translation (preparation of resource
bundles), Translation testing (Is the translation acceptable?), and more.</p>
