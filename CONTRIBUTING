# Contributing to Eclipse Babel

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse Babel is a set of tools to make the job of globalizing Eclipse projects
easier. We also want to provide ways for people world wide, who are interested,
to contribute translations in their language of choice. The project includes
tools and activities that are needed to adapt the Eclipse deliverables to
properly run in multiple locales and to translate selected Eclipse projects into
multiple different languages (French, Japanese, German, etc). The project could
eventually include tools to aid in the following areas: Enablement testing (E.g.
can the software run in different language environments and handle multiple
scripts, etc.), translatability testing (is it ready for translation?),
preparation for translation (preparation of resource bundles), Translation
testing (Is the translation acceptable?), and more.
